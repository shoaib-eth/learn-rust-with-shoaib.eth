# Learn Rust with shoaib.eth

This repository contains my Rust learning journey, starting with the basics.

## Hello, World!

Created a simple "Hello, World!" program using Rust.

### Commands Learned

1. **`cargo new`** – Create a new Rust project.  
2. **`cargo build`** – Compile the project.  
3. **`cargo run`** – Build and run the project.  
4. **`cargo check`** – Check for errors without building.  
5. **`cargo build --release`** – Build the project with optimizations.

More programs and learning updates will be added as I progress.
